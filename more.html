    <p>The following is an assignment from my 3D modeling course, which is a big sword. </p>
      <p>  The dimensions of this sword are 83cm long, 26cm wide and 5cm thick.</p>
        <p> This was a birthday present for another friend of mine. It just so happened that I could finish preparing gifts while completing my homework. </p>
        <p> This piece was difficult to print due to its large size. Printing has failed three times this week, but there was no error when I reprinted this Friday.</p>
         <p> Hope it can be printed successfully. If it is printed successfully, I think the visual effect will be very stunning.</p>
