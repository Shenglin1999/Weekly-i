        <p>This is our last week. During this semester I learned a lot of skills and knowledge about designing web pages. This is a very valuable experience for me. This semester is coming to an end in a blink of an eye, and the new year is about to come. </p>
            <p>I was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief and relax for a while. The period at the end of the semester is really mentally draining. Although the process of doing these final assignments was very torturous, the sense of accomplishment when I completed them also made me very happy.</p>
            <p> My ceramics assignment was to make four animal sculptures. This assignment is also a birthday present I prepared for a friend of mine. There are four pets in his family, three dogs and one cat.</p>
